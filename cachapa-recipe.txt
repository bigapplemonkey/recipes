INGREDIENTS
Corn kernels, fresh or frozen -- 4 cups (about 1 1/2 pounds)
Cornstarch -- 1/2 cup
Melted butter or olive oil-- 2 tablespoons
Sugar -- 1 tablespoon
Salt -- 2 teaspoons
Water -- as needed
METHOD
If using frozen corn, thaw it first. Add the corn, cornstarch, butter or oil, sugar and salt to a food processor or blender and process until fairly smooth but still a little chunky. Add water as needed to give the batter a consistency a little thicker than heavy cream.
Heat a heavy skillet over medium flame. Wipe the skillet with a little oil or butter and add about 1/2 cup of the batter to the skillet and spread it out a bit. Turn when the surface bubbles and the bottoms are golden brown, about 2 to 2 1/2 minutes, and brown on the other side.
Hold in a warm oven and repeat with the remaining batter. Serve hot, spread with butter or folded around your favorite filling.
